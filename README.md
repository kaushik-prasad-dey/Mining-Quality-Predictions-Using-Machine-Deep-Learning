# Mining-Quality-Predictions-Using-Machine-Deep-Learning
## Description
In this hands-on project, we will train machine learning and deep learning models to predict the % of Silica Concentrate in the Iron ore concentrate per minute. This Project could be practically used in mining Industry to get the % Silica Concentrate at much faster rate compared to traditional methods.

### Freeport-McMoRan is one of the largest mining companies in U.S. They have made use of Custom-buit Al models to boost the output in their mining facilities.

By leveraging past 3+ years data, AI has helped the mining faciality sustain a faster production pace with no loss of efficiency. Efficiency has been Improved by performing operational tweaks to boost output. (Ex, copper production could be increased if the mill will was fed with more ore per minute).
